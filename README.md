# PriorizationPipeline

An adaptation of the variant prioritization pipeline originally developed to be used for Broad Institute's GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) to the Illumina DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics) Bio-IT Platform. 

## Description

The PrioritizationPipeline script is used to annotate variants called by DRAGEN with features including frequency and quality filters, damage type and ranks, as well as main and secondary findings for the purpose of variant prioritization. The script also generates pre-defined summary statistics such as chromosome-wise zygosity type counts and the number of variants in each category of interest.
